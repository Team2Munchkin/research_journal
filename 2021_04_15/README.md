# Experiment: compare brute force and non-brute force
* Branch used: compare_brute_force_and_non_brute_force
* Commit: c57fe79
* Method: I changed the file src/compare_brute_force_non_brute_force.py to set up the relevant parameters 
(dimensions, number of particles, number of tests) and then generated a table. This was used to make the plots
using qtiplot
